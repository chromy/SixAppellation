Teixcalaan series.

Below summarises the available information on Teixcalaan Names and contains minor spoilers for both books.

## Teixcalaan Names

> *"Three Seagrass" was an old-fashioned Teixcalaanli name: the numeral half was low value, and the noun half was the name of a plant, even if it was a plant Mahit hadn't seen used in a name before. All of the noun parts of Teixcalaanli names were plants or tools or inanimate objects, but most of the plant ones were flowers.*  
> A Memory Called Empire, Chapter One

Teixcalaan names are formed of two parts, a number part and a nount part.
The number part is a positive integer normally less than 100 and commonly under 20.
The noun part is a plant, an inanimate object, or a concept.
The highest number confirmed as part of a character name is 84 in *Eighty-Four Twilight*. There is also an in-universe fictional character named *Ninety Alloy* who is the eponymous protagonist of a holoproduction.

## Use-names

> *Eight Antidote liked being called Cure a lot better than Your Excellency, but maybe he didn't deserve an affectionate use-name right now.*  
> A Desolation Called Peace, Chapter Ten

Many characters have a 'use-name' or nickname often derived from the noun half of their name.
[Basic rules for Teixcalaanli names](https://www.torforgeblog.com/2021/02/15/whats-in-a-teixcalaanli-name/) writes names together with use-names like: `Three Seagrass à 'Reed'`. However the glossaries for both books use the phrasing `Seagrass [...] Sometimes called Petal.`

## Titles
- The Emperor has the style `His/Her/Their Brilliance`
- *ezuazuacat* — A member of the emperor's personal advisory council, has the style `His/Her/Their Excellency`
- *ixplanatl* — An accredited scientist
- *asekreta* — An actively serving member of the Information Ministry
- *cuecuelihui* — A non-officer military rank
- *ikantlos* — A military rank; normally a battle group commander
- *yaotlek* — A military rank; commander of at least one legion
- *tlaxlauim* — A certified accountant or financial professional

## Epithet
>*"Her Excellency, the ezuazuacat Nineteen Adze," Three Seagrass went on, and then murmured, "whose gracious presence illuminates the room like the edgeshine of a knife," one fifteen-syllable-long participial phrase in Teixcalaanli, as if the woman in white came with her own premade poetic epithet. Perhaps she did.*  
> A Memory Called Empire, Chapter Three

A minority of of characters have a poetic epithet. It's unclear where these arise from. The canon epithets are:
- *"whose gracious presence illuminates the room like the edgeshine of a knife"*
- *"he who drowns the world in blooms"*
- *"she who kindles enmity in the most oath-sworn heart"*
- *"he who writes patterns into the world"*

Mahit also describes "radiant blaze" as the epithet for Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare.
